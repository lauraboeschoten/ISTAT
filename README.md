This is the datapackage corresponding to the paper "Combining Multiple Imputation and Hidden Markov Modeling to Obtain Consistent Estimates of Employment Status" from
Laura Boeschoten, Danila Filipponi and Roberta Varriale published on January 8 2020 in Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology, smz052, https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smz052. 

The datapackage consists of 6 folders, referring to the 6 simulation conditions in terms of data quality and sample size discussed in the paper. 
In each folder, you find 6 subfolders referring to different approaches for estimating results when implementing the HMM-MI approach:
- no imputation
- single imputation
- 5 or 10 multiple imputations without bootstrap for parameter uncertainty
- 5 of 10 multiple imputations including bootstrap for parameter uncertainty
